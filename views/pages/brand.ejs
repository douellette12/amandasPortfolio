        <p>Iâ€™ve incorporated my personal style in my branding and throughout my portfolio. I find clean, simplistic designs visually appealing and enjoy experimenting with pops of color and various typograhy. I was inspired by others whose portfolios reflected their authentic selves, and I strived to produce a product that too echoed who I am as a person and designer.
        </p>
        <p>The first time I started to design in Figma was for my personal style tile. Below are the first two versions I created, and through helpful feedback sessions I was able to create something that feels authentic to me.</p>
